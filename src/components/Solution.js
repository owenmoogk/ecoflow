            <p>After identifying the issue of Canadian water consumption problems, we need a way to address this.</p>
            <p>Our vision is a world where mindful water usage is the social norm, with people respecting the limited capacity that the earth has to offer. We are pushing to achieve this goal, and are working to design a solution that can make this a simple task for homeowners.</p>

            <p>Through the implementation of an application and water monitoring sensor, homeowners can have a proper sense of their water usage, and can adjust accordingly. Check it out!</p>
